 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_OTTO_I_AHU_DESC:0 "Otto von Habsburg was Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary in name only, after the empire was dissolved in 1918. In these times of political turmoil, the people of Austria and Hungary have called upon him to unite the two countries once again."
 POLITICS_OTTO_I_HUN_DESC:0 "Otto von Habsburg was Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary in name only, after the empire was dissolved in 1918. As his father, Charles died in 1922, the Kingdom of Hungary has elected him as king, when the need of a new monarch arose."
 POLITICS_FERENC_SZALASI_DESC:0 "Ferenc Szálasi was installed by the German government, to ensure Hungarian loyalty and cooperation during the war."
 POLITICS_MIKLOS_HORTHY_DESC:0 "Miklós Horthy was a rear-admiral of the Austro-Hungarian navy, but after the dissolution of the empire, when the Hungarian Soviet Republic took power, he was one of the organizers of the counter-revolutionary army in Szeged. He played an important role in restoring the Hungarian monarchy, eventually accepting the position of regent, thus making Hungary into a 'Kingdom without a king'."
 POLITICS_MIKLOS_HORTHY_KING_DESC:0 "Miklós Horthy was a rear-admiral of the Austro-Hungarian navy, but after the dissolution of the empire, when the Hungarian Soviet Republic took power, he was one of the organizers of the counter-revolutionary army in Szeged. He played an important role in restoring the Hungarian monarchy, eventually accepting the position of regent. Now he reigns as Hungary's newly elected king, ending a long period of foreign monarchs on the Hungarian throne."
 POLITICS_MATYAS_RAKOSKI_DESC:0 "Rákosi was the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party after the second world war ended. His rule was defined by hardcore communism, and a personal cult, similar to that of Stalin. The unofficial motto of his system was 'Whoever is not with us, is against us', as opposed to the later system of János Kádár, which had the friendlier approach of 'Whoever is not against us, is with us'."
 POLITICS_ENDRE_BAJCSY_ZSILINSZKY_DESC:0 "Bajcsy Zsilinszky was a right wing democrat in pre-war Hungary. He was a staunch opposer of Germany's expansionist politics, and detested alignment with Hitler's Axis."
 POLITICS_JANOS_KADAR_DESC:0 "Historically, Kádár was the successor to Mátyás Rákosi, and held slightly different beliefs, than his predecessor. While Rákosi's system was characterized by hardline communism, Kádár's is remembered as "Show-window communism", meaning that it was much like a showcase of communist prosperity towards the west. His rule was loved by many, though the system was not sustainable, due to the enormous loans the country had to take to pay for it."
 POLITICS_ISTVAN_HORTHY_DESC:0 "István Horthy is the son of the former regent, Miklós Horthy. His political views are moderate, but slightly westward leaning. He served in the Hungarian air force as a fighter pilot, and survived a dangerous accident while flying on his last mission."
 POLITICS_ISTVAN_HORTHY_JR_DESC:0 "The son of the late István Horthy, and the grandson of the former regent, Miklós Horthy, the young István is but a child, who has been given an entire country to govern. Currently, he is guided by a council of advisors, who rule in his stead until he comes of age."
 POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_DESC:0 "Victor Emmanuel is the king of Italy, and now Hungary. He was chosen to succeed Horthy as a king, and has now assumed that position. His political views are somewhat liberal, though he could not excercise them in Italy, as he was mostly just a figurehead."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_HOHENZOLLERN_HUN_DESC:0 "Wilhelm von Hohenzollern is the crown prince of the old German Empire, and now the king of Hungary as well. He fought in the Great War, and was exiled after the empire lost, but returned to Germany. He was involved in German politics to some extent, but never rose to prominence. Now that he is king of Hungary, he has the ability to guide the fate of a nation, like his father before him."
 POLITICS_BELA_KUN_DESC:0 "Béla Kun was one of the most prominent leaders of the Hungarian Council Republic, that emerged after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. With the previous government disbanding the army in the face of the invading Entente powers, the communist republic was doomed to fail. Kun has now returned to Hungary, to once again try to realize this dream of a communist country in the Carpathian Basin."
 POLITICS_MIHALY_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "Mihály Károlyi was the prime minister and president of the Hungarian Council Republic in 1918-1919. After the fall of the short-lived communist state, he emigrated. As a strong critic of the Horthy administration, he was branded an enemy of the state in 1923. After the reestablished, and again defeated communist regime in Hungary, his connections abroad helped him negotiate a place for a government in exile."
 POLITICS_IMRE_NAGY_DESC:0 "Imre Nagy was an important figure during the years of illegality for communism in Hungary. Historically, he ended up emigrating to the Soviet Union until 1944, when he became part of the post-war communist leadership of Hungary. His political view were more moderate than that of his peers during the early years of communist rule after the second World War, which put him in conflict with Mátyás Rákosi following the death of Stalin. Rákosi was favored by the party leadership in the end, but his triumph resulted in the revolution of 1956, which elevated Imre Nagy to the position of head of government again for a brief period. Nagy wished to establish a socialist state that was not based on repression and aggressive policing of opinions."

 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary became independent during the Great War after a long time of foreign rulership, and thus, master of her own fate again. The Treaty of Trianon left the country with one third of its former territory, and half of its former population. Many would like to see the old borders restored, but the surrounding nations are not at all willing to compromise. There are still supporters of the old Habsburg monarchy, but communist and liberal ideas have also taken root in the country.\n\nThe next few years might very well decide the fate of Hungary for the remainder of the century."
 HUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The past few years saw the restoration of Southern Slovakia, and Carpathian Ruthenia to the Kingdom of Hungary. Now, with the assistance of Germany, the government is looking to negotiate the revision of Romanian borders, and it looks like Romania might be willing to cooperate, under German arbitration. Hungary is slowly coming under the influence of The Third Reich, inevitably drawing itself into the coming conflict.\n\n Only time will tell, if Hungary rises from the mud of war victorious, regaining lost territory, or beaten, losing more than ever before."
