 hungary_flavor.25.d:0 "Italy owns Zara, a port city in the northern parts of Dalmatia. We could request that they hand it over, in exchange for the help we offer."
 hungary_flavor.25.a:0 "We will include Zara in the proposal."
 hungary_flavor.25.b:0 "We do not need Zara."
 
 hungary_flavor.26.t:0 "The question of Istria"
 hungary_flavor.26.d:0 "Italy owns Istria, a historically Croatian province. We could request that they hand it over, in exchange for the help we offer."
 hungary_flavor.26.a:0 "We will include Istria in the proposal."
 hungary_flavor.26.b:0 "We do not need Istria."
 
 hungary_flavor.27.t:0 "Italy accepts conditions"
 hungary_flavor.27.d:0 "Italy has agreed to our conditions. The pact has been signed, and both sides seemed satisfied with the results."
 hungary_flavor.27.a:0 "A successful agreement."
 
 hungary_flavor.28.t:0 "Italy refuses to negotiate"
 hungary_flavor.28.d:0 "The Italian foreign minister has dismissed our ambassadors, saying that they can not negotiate with the conditions we proposed."
 hungary_flavor.28.a:0 "Worrying."
 
 hungary_flavor.30.t:0 "German alliance"
 hungary_flavor.30.d:0 "The Foreign Ministers of [Root.GetName] and Germany have officially signed the treaty, which allows [Root.GetName] into the Axis."
 hungary_flavor.30.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 hungary_flavor.31.t:0 "Germany refuses alliance"
 hungary_flavor.31.d:0 "Germany has surprisingly refused our request, denying entry into the Axis."
 hungary_flavor.31.a:0 "What arrogance."
 
 hungary_flavor.32.t:0 "Soviet alliance"
 hungary_flavor.32.d:0 "The mighty Soviet Union has accepted our request for membership in the Communist International. The flag of the revolution shall rise high this day, for we are part of something much greater than ourselves!"
 hungary_flavor.32.a:0 "Workers rejoice!"
 
 hungary_flavor.33.t:0 "Soviet Union refuses alliance"
 hungary_flavor.33.d:0 "We have been neglected by the motherland of communism. They have rejected our proposed alliance, and thus, we must carry on with the revolution on our own."
 hungary_flavor.33.a:0 "They will see reason eventually."
 
 hungary_flavor.34.t:0 "Alliance with the UK"
 hungary_flavor.34.d:0 "After a short series of negoriations, the government of the United Kingdom has accepted our proposal, and granted us membership in their alliance. We shall now enjoy the protection of the Allies, in the case of an attack from any adversary."
 hungary_flavor.34.a:0 "Superb!"
 
 hungary_flavor.35.t:0 "United Kingdom declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.35.d:0 "Our request to join the Allies was turned down by th United Kingdom. It seems that we are left alone in this fight of ours."
 hungary_flavor.35.a:0 "What a disgrace."
 
 hungary_flavor.36.t:0 "The Danubian Conference"
 hungary_flavor.36.d:0 "Budapest will host the conference, at which the Danubian Coalition will (hopefully) be born. Invitations have been sent to all of our unaligned neighbors, and some countries in the Balkans. The more nations we can convince to join the coalition, the stronger our alliance will be."
 hungary_flavor.36.a:0 "Let the event commence."
 
 hungary_flavor.37.t:0 "Czechoslovakia reenters the Empire"
 hungary_flavor.37.d:0 "Czechoslovakia has seen reason, and accepted our proposal. They are once again where they belong, under the protective wings of Austria-Hungary."
 hungary_flavor.37.a:0 "Excellent news."
 
 hungary_flavor.38.t:0 "Czechoslovakia refuses to join the empire"
 hungary_flavor.38.d:0 "Czechoslovakia seems to foster unreasonable amounts of national pride (as if they were a proper nation to begin with), and refused to join the Empire."
 hungary_flavor.38.a:0 "Perhaps we should try a different approach."
 
 hungary_flavor.39.t:0 "Poland yields"
 hungary_flavor.39.d:0 "Poland agreed to our reasonable demand, and ceded all of the territories immediately. Krakow and Galicia are once again ours to rule over. In return for their generous cooperation, the Poles have our guarantee, that no furhter harm will befall their country."
 hungary_flavor.39.a:0 "Excellent news."
 
 hungary_flavor.40.t:0 "Poland refuses"
 hungary_flavor.40.d:0 "Poland declined our generous proposal, and instead chose to risk the anger of the Empire. It would seem that they don't listen to reason."
 hungary_flavor.40.a:0 "They will listen to guns."
 
 hungary_flavor.41.t:0 "Romania yields"
 hungary_flavor.41.d:0 "As expected, Romania has given in to the demands, and ceded Bucovina. It is a small gain, but a gain nevertheless"
 hungary_flavor.41.a:0 "Excellent news."
 
 hungary_flavor.42.t:0 "Romania refuses"
 hungary_flavor.42.d:0 "Romania must think that we were joking when we asked for Bucovina. They dismissed the proposal immediately, and sent our diplomats home."
 hungary_flavor.42.a:0 "Do they want to fall because of a small piece of land?"
 
 hungary_flavor.43.t:0 "Negotiations with the Imperialist Czechoslovakian government"
 hungary_flavor.43.d:0 "The newly established imperialist government in Czechoslovakia has initiated negotiations with us. They wish to aid our efforts as best as they can, and would happily join our faction to do so."
 hungary_flavor.43.a:0 "Welcome them into The New Central Powers"
 hungary_flavor.43.b:0 "There is no need for open cooperation yet."
 
 hungary_flavor.45.t:0 "Austria allows Burgenland referendum"
 hungary_flavor.45.d:0 "Our new friend, Austira, has allowed the referendum in Burgenland, that we proposed. Now the people living there are free to choose between staying in Austria, or joining Hungary. All we have to do is hope for the best of results."
 hungary_flavor.45.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 hungary_flavor.46.t:0 "Austria disallows Burgenland referendum"
 hungary_flavor.46.d:0 "The Austrian government has declined the proposed referendum for Burgenland. If they were not allies of Hungary, this would be considered as an act of offense, and would be dealt with in kind. This may well end up tearing our faction apart."
 hungary_flavor.46.a:0 "Disappointing."
 hungary_flavor.46.b:0 "Very well. We shall take it by force."
 
 hungary_flavor.47.t:0 "Slovenia for Burgenland"
 hungary_flavor.47.d:0 "We have acquired Slovenia in the recent years, and Austria still holds the old Hungarian province of Burgenland. It would make sense to exchange these territories between the two countries, and restore historical borders. Will we make this offer to Austria?"
 hungary_flavor.47.a:0 "Of course."
 hungary_flavor.47.b:0 "The borders are good just the way they are."
 
 hungary_flavor.48.t:0 "Austria accepts Slovenian trade"
 hungary_flavor.48.d:0 "Austria made the sensible decision to accept Slovenia in exchange for Burgenland. Both states have been restored to their historical owners."
 hungary_flavor.48.a:0 "Very well."
 
 hungary_flavor.49.t:0 "Austria declines Slovenian trade"
 hungary_flavor.49.d:0 "It may come as a surprise, but Austria refused to cede Burgenland in return for Slovenia. The territorial gains would certainly have outweighed the losses, and they would have regained a province that is traditionally theirs."
 hungary_flavor.49.a:0 "Strange."
 
 hungary_flavor.50.t:0 "The 'Györi Program'"
 hungary_flavor.50.d:0 "As our armament efforts were limited for a long time, due to the peace agreements after the Great War, the [Root.GetAdjective] army is in dire need of modernisation. A rearmament plan developed by Béla Imrédy proposes a thorough reformation and restructuration of not just the army, but the industry of the country. The total cost of the execution would be a billion Hungarian Pengös, 400 millions of which would go towards defense, and insutry development, while 600 million would go directly to the army, and research. The funds would be acquired through one time taxes, and short-term loans."
 hungary_flavor.50.a:0 "Approve of the plan."
 hungary_flavor.50.b:0 "This would be too expensive."
 
 hungary_flavor.51.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase I is ready"
 hungary_flavor.51.d:0 "The first phase of the Györi Program is ready to be put into action. Research, and industrial development are the primary focuses of this part of the plan, thus many construction grants and research agreements have been negotiated to this end. We should take advantage of these agreements, before they expire."
 hungary_flavor.51.a:0 "[Root.GetName] will prevail."
 
 hungary_flavor.52.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase II is ready"
 hungary_flavor.52.d:0 "The second phase of the Györi Program is now ready to be put into action. The focus of the plan now shifts towards the army, and defense efforts. A modernisation of the army, and the protection of our borders are in order, if we want to survive any military conflict."
 hungary_flavor.52.a:0 "Our army shall be the best."
 
 hungary_flavor.53.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase III is ready"
 hungary_flavor.53.d:0 "The third phase of the Györi Program is ready to be executed. The national aviation effort is far behind that of the surrounding countries, and as such, deserves special attention during the plan. We need to spend every effort to develop new aircraft models, and put them through production."
 hungary_flavor.53.a:0 "The skies will know the might of [Root.GetName]."
 
 hungary_flavor.54.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase IV is ready"
 hungary_flavor.54.d:0 "The fourth, and final phase of the Györi Program focuses on the navy. Initially, the navy was not included in the plan, due to lack of any ports in the country. Some extra funds have enabled us to invest in naval development, and production."
 hungary_flavor.54.a:0 "The navy shall be great once again."
 
 hungary_flavor.55.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective]-Yugoslavian Eternal Friendship"
 hungary_flavor.55.d:0 "The Pact of Eternal Friendship between [Root.GetName] and Yugoslavia has been signed, officially cementing the good relations, and cooperation between the two countries. This might be the beginning of an alliance, that might help defend both nations from foreign threats."
 hungary_flavor.55.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 hungary_flavor.56.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines Eternal Friendship"
 hungary_flavor.56.d:0 "Perhaps still feeling threatened by the possibility of revisionist claims from [Root.GetName], Yugoslavia has dismissed the idea of cooperation between our countries. Surely, this is not meant as an act of hostility, merely a sign of caution on their behalf."
 hungary_flavor.56.a:0 "A shame."
 
 hungary_flavor.57.t:0 "Territorial settlement with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.57.d:0 "Though we have declared our friensdhip with Yugoslavia, there is still the question of our territorial disputes. Novi Sad clearly belongs to us, and Yugoslavia needs our help, if it is to succeed in future endeavours. We promise them help in the future, if they cede Vojvodina to us, as a sign of friendship."
 hungary_flavor.57.a:0 "They will surely agree that Novi Sad is Hungarian."
 hungary_flavor.57.b:0 "We cannot risk the good relations with them for territorial gains."
 
 hungary_flavor.58.t:0 "Successful negotiations with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.58.d:0 "Yugoslavia has accepted our proposal, and handed over control of Novi Sad. They clearly take our friendship seriously, and rightly so. We will make right on our promises, and support their political efforts."
 hungary_flavor.58.a:0 "A fruit of the friendship between our countries."
 
 hungary_flavor.59.t:0 "Unsuccessful negotiations with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.59.d:0 "Yugoslavia has understandably refused to cede Novi Sad. We offered little in return, and their territorial integrity is backed by the Allies. The friendship between our countries might not yet come to an end, but everybody left the negotiating table with a sour taste in their mouths."
 hungary_flavor.59.a:0 "This is bound to hurt our relations with them."
 
 hungary_flavor.60.t:0 "Alliance with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.60.d:0 "Yugoslavia has proven to be a willing partner in cooperation, and our political views align with theirs. To further strengthen our friendship, we should invite them into our faction, and guarantee to defend one another in conflicts to come."
 hungary_flavor.60.a:0 "Of course, we shall invite them."
 hungary_flavor.60.b:0 "We don't have to drag them into this."
 
 hungary_flavor.61.t:0 "Yugoslavia accepts alliance"
 hungary_flavor.61.d:0 "The Treaty of Eternal Friendship between [Root.GetName] and Yugoslavia has been extended to include a military alliance. They have joined our faction, and will now enjoy our protection, just as we will enjoy their help."
 hungary_flavor.61.a:0 "A toast to our friendship!"
 
 hungary_flavor.62.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.62.d:0 "The negotiations about an alliance with Yugoslavia have been a failure. They outright rejected the proposal, not wanting to get involved in any of our political struggles. It would seem that they value their neutrality too much."
 hungary_flavor.62.a:0 "They don't know what they're missing out on."
 
 hungary_flavor.63.t:0 "Funding for the Györi Program"
 hungary_flavor.63.d:0 "Some investors have approached the governmental coordinators, responsible for the execution of the Györi Program. They expressed their interest in the success of the armament, as they own stocks of various industrial concerns affected. These investors are willing to provide funding for the program, in the form of generous, low-interest loans."
 hungary_flavor.63.a:0 "Money is always welcome."
 
 hungary_flavor.64.t:0 "Italy accepts demands"
 hungary_flavor.64.d:0 "Italy made the sensible decision to accept the Greek territories in return for giving up the Austro-Hungarian ones. Maybe they only did it to keep the peace, maybe they misjudged the value of the provinces. Whichever the case, the deal is sealed."
 hungary_flavor.64.a:0 "Surprising, but welcome news."
 
 hungary_flavor.65.t:0 "Italy declines demands"
 hungary_flavor.65.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, Italy has refused to relinquish control over our former territory. The promise of Greek territories was not enough to convince them, and they fail to see the true strength of our nation. Our former territories remain in Italian hands."
 hungary_flavor.65.a:0 "It's a shame we will have to take them by force."
 
 hungary_flavor.66.t:0 "Germany opposes Austro-Hungarian cooperation"
 hungary_flavor.66.d:0 "Our effort to restore Austria-Hungary have not gone unnoticed, and Germany is ready to take action against them. If we do not cease negotiations with Austria, they threaten military intervention, if necessary."
 hungary_flavor.66.a:0 "Continue negotiations."
 hungary_flavor.66.b:0 "Back down."
 
 hungary_flavor.67.t:0 "The capital of Austria-Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.67.d:0 "The monarchy of Austria-Hungary has been restored, but historically, she had her capital in Vienna. Granted that the union was originally under Austrian leadership, and now it is under Hungarian, it might still be strategically beneficial, to move the capital to Vienna.\n\nMoving the capital to Vienna would change the country's map color to white."
 hungary_flavor.67.a:0 "We'll stick with Budapest."
 hungary_flavor.67.b:0 "Vienna it is."
 
 hungary_flavor.78.t:0 "Possible exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.78.d:0 "As the war is turning more and more in the favor of our enemy, it might be time to plan our exit from the war. As Bismarck once said, 'No nation ought to sacrifice itself on the altar of an alliance'."
 hungary_flavor.78.a:0 "We will consider our options."
 hungary_flavor.78.c:0 "We will be forever loyal to the Axis."
 
 hungary_flavor.79.t:0 "Soviets support exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.79.d:0 "The negotiations were successful. The Soviet Union has agreed to support our exit attempt, and promised to protect us, once we abandon Germany."
 hungary_flavor.79.a:0 "At least we might still be on the winning side."
 
 hungary_flavor.80.t:0 "Joining the Soviet Union"
 hungary_flavor.80.d:0 "Arrangements were made to withdraw all Hungarian forces from potential danger, and a Soviet-friendly government has been set up. Everything is set for our exit attempt, now we have to hope for the best and trust in our new allies to defend us against Germany."
 hungary_flavor.80.a:0 "We have made our choice."
 
 hungary_flavor.81.t:0 "Soviets rebuff exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.81.d:0 "The Soviet Union refused to negotiate our exit, stating that they will not negotiate with the enemy."
 hungary_flavor.81.a:0 "We're stuck with the Germans then."
 
 hungary_flavor.82.t:0 "Allies support exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.82.d:0 "The negotiations were successful. The Allies have agreed to support our exit attempt, and promised to protect us, once we abandon Germany."
 hungary_flavor.82.a:0 "At least we might still be on the winning side."
 
 hungary_flavor.83.t:0 "Joining the Allies"
 hungary_flavor.83.d:0 "Arrangements were made to withdraw all Hungarian forces from potential danger, and a temporary government has been set up. Everything is set for our exit attempt, now we have to hope for the best and trust in our new allies to defend us against Germany."
 hungary_flavor.83.a:0 "We have made our choice."
 
 hungary_flavor.84.t:0 "Allies rebuff exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.84.d:0 "The United Kingdom refused to negotiate our exit, stating that they will not negotiate with the enemy."
 hungary_flavor.84.a:0 "We're stuck with the Germans then."
 
 hungary_flavor.85.t:0 "The Arrow Cross Party"
 hungary_flavor.85.d:0 "An unexpected turn of events has caused great commotion in the country. German forces have crossed the border, and occupied key facilities, including administrative buildings in the capital. The previous government has been replaced with the fascist Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szálasi, which took control of the country immediately. This is most likely the German's way of saying they don't trust us to follow their lead."
 hungary_flavor.85.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 hungary_flavor.85.b:0 "Get ready to fight!"
 hungary_flavor.85.tt:0 "The Arrow Cross Party will become the ruling party, with Ferenc Szálasi as its head.\n"
 
 hungary_flavor.86.t:0 "Romania withdraws from Banat"
 hungary_flavor.86.d:0 "Our threat proved to be enough to scare the Romanians. All of their forces were withdrawn from the borders, leaving Banat free to be annexed by us."
 hungary_flavor.86.a:0 "The cowards flee, and the brave conquer."
 
 hungary_flavor.87.t:0 "Romania refuses to withdraw from Banat"
 hungary_flavor.87.d:0 "The threat was not enough to coerce Romania into ceding Banat. We can now declare war over the territory, or back down. Not declaring would make us seem weak internationally, as we have made explicit threats stating the opposite."
 hungary_flavor.87.a:0 "They will regret this."
 hungary_flavor.87.b:0 "We won't waste sweat and blood for such a small piece of land."
 
 hungary_flavor.88.t:0 "Turkey accepts alliance"
 hungary_flavor.88.d:0 "The agreement has been signed, Turkey is now officially a member of [Root.GetFactionName]. In the event of a war, the two countries will now stand, or fall together."
 hungary_flavor.88.a:0 "This is an important step in the right direction."
 
 hungary_flavor.89.t:0 "Turkey declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.89.d:0 "Perhaps the new Turkish state has lost all of its pride, or desire for greatness, because they decided to stay out of our faction, and be left out of all the glory and rewards that would have come with it."
 hungary_flavor.89.a:0 "We are better off without them anyway."
 
 hungary_flavor.90.t:0 "Support for democratic elections in Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.90.d:0 "Liberal ideas have taken hold of the country, and support for democratic elections is on the rise. We better prepare for a change in government."
 hungary_flavor.90.a:0 "What a time to be alive."
 
 hungary_flavor.91.t:0 "Support for communism in Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.91.d:0 "Worker unions are organising protests and strikes countrywide, while the communist party is preparing to set up a new government. Either through elections, or a forceful rebellion, communism will eventually grab hold of the power in Hungary."
 hungary_flavor.91.a:0 "What a time to be alive."
 
 hungary_flavor.92.t:0 "Miklós Horthy: Regent, or King"
 hungary_flavor.92.d:0 "It is no secret, that our regent, Miklós Horthy, would like his son to succeed him, effectively starting a new ruling dynasty in Hungary. There is some support for crowning him King of Hungary, which would finally put an end to the regency, though some might see this as an undemocratic move. Will we support his claim to the throne?"
 hungary_flavor.92.a:0 "We will not assist in creating another dynasty."
 hungary_flavor.92.b:0 "Long live the King!"
 
 hungary_flavor.93.t:0 "Reinstatement of Miklós Horthy"
 hungary_flavor.93.d:0 "Miklós Horthy will be reinstated as commander of our new navy, the only question is what his role should be. Should he become an admiral again, or rather direct our naval effort from the back, as chief of navy?"
 hungary_flavor.93.a:0 "Horthy will become the chief of navy."
 hungary_flavor.93.b:0 "He will be reestablished as an admiral."
 
 hungary_flavor.94.t:0 "Germany agrees to help"
 hungary_flavor.94.d:0 "Not only did Germany agree to sending a delegation to aid us, they also transferred two of their generals to lead our troops. This is a massive success, and an important milestone in the cooperation of our nations."
 hungary_flavor.94.d_2:0 "Germany agreed to send the delegation we asked for. Part of the General Staff will now be directing the military efforts of Hungary, and aiding our high command."
 hungary_flavor.94.a:0 "Wonderful news."
 hungary_flavor.94.b:0 "Wonderful news."
 hungary_flavor.94.tt:0 "Generals Erwin von Witzleben and Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb will report for duty."
 
 hungary_flavor.95.t:0 "Germany refuses to help"
 hungary_flavor.95.d:0 "For some strange reason, Germany declined our request for closer cooperation. We will have to rely on our own military staff to direct the coordination of the army."
 hungary_flavor.95.a:0 "This is disappointing, to say the least."
 
 hungary_flavor.96.t:0 "Turkish troop exchange"
 hungary_flavor.96.d:0 "Turkey agreed to the troop exchange program. We will shortly be greeting the brigades that they sent us, and our divisions are already on their way to Istanbul."
 hungary_flavor.96.a:0 "This will bring our nations even closer to one another."
 hungary_flavor.96.tt:0 "We will receive two infantry divisions from Turkey.\n"
 
 hungary_flavor.97.t:0 "Turkey declines troop exchange proposal"
 hungary_flavor.97.d:0 "The Turkish government rejected our offer of troop exchange, probably due to the risk they would be putting their soldiers in. Perhaps it is best that we both stick to our own armies."
 hungary_flavor.97.a:0 "They surely have their reasons."
 
 hungary_flavor.98.t:0 "Trianon restrictions invalidated"
 hungary_flavor.98.d:0 "As we are now part of an alliance, no one can enforce the restrictions set by the allies after the Great War anymore. Our friends will protect our right to arm ourselves. While foreign powers might still try to interfere in our expansion, at least the technical retrictions set by the treaty no longer apply."
 hungary_flavor.98.d_2:0 "The military restrictions set by the allies after the Great War are long forgotten, even by those who set them. In today's ever-changing political climate, such a restriction can not be enforced anymore. While foreign powers might still try to interfere in our expansion, at least the technical retrictions set by the treaty no longer apply."
 hungary_flavor.98.a:0 "Together we are strong."
 hungary_flavor.98.b:0 "Were those restrictions still valid? I didn't notice."
 
 hungary_flavor.99.t:0 "Györi program goes against Trianon restrictions"
 hungary_flavor.99.d:0 "The armament program we started is openly violating the military restrictions set by the allies at Trianon. We are not supposed to research, or manufacture artillery, armored vehicles, and aircraft. We could try to keep to these boundaries, and still continue with the program, but it would slow our efforts noticeably."
 hungary_flavor.99.a:0 "We will openly disobey the constraints."
 hungary_flavor.99.b:0 "Perform the restricted research in secret."
 hungary_flavor.99.c:0 "Try our best to stay within the boundaries."

 hungary_flavor.100.d_pol:0 "Only Poland agreed to enter our alliance. Nevertheless, the faction will be formed, even if only with two founding members."
 hungary_flavor.100.d_neither:0 "Disaster! Neither Czechoslovakia, nor Poland entered the proposed alliance. We are left alone in our fight."
 hungary_flavor.100.a:0 "The Visegrád Triangle is strong."
 hungary_flavor.100.b:0 "We will build a strong alliance with Czechoslovakia."

 hungary_flavor.101.d:0 "The Baltic expansion has been a partial success. We could not convince all Baltic states to join, but the alliance expands nevertheless."
 hungary_flavor.101.d_none:0 "The Baltic states have all rejected our request. It seems we must look elsewhere, if we still wish to expand the alliance."

 hungary_flavor.103.t:0 "Albania wants to join our faction"
 hungary_flavor.103.d:0 "After the successful partition of Yugoslavia, Albania has approached us with a request to join our faction. Perhaps they mistook our generosity regarding the state of Montenegro, for an act of friendship. At any rate, we have to deal with their request. What is our response?"

 hungary_flavor.104.d:0 "Germany has now annexed Bohemia, and the Czechoslovakian state is falling to pieces. They do not have explicit plans of their own for Carpathian Ruthenia, which means we could simply invade it without any real consequences. We could let the small territory be self-governed, but taking it would be an important step towards reclaiming our old territory."

 hungary_flavor.104.b:0 "We don't care about borders."
 
 hungary_flavor.105.t:0 "Italian Alliance"
 hungary_flavor.105.d:0 "After the Yugoslavian conference was over, Italian ambassadors have approached our delegation with a proposal. In return for giving in to their claims in Yugoslavia, they are willing to join our alliance, and join forces with us."

 hungary_flavor.105.b:0 "Politely refuse their initiative."
 
 hungary_flavor.106.t:0 "Hungarian-Slovakian Small War"
 hungary_flavor.106.d:0 "Our borders with Slovakia were not strictly defined after the annexation of Carpathian Ruthenia. In an attempt to secure the valley of Ung, our forces have launched an offensive against Slovakia from the west, taking minimal losses. Slovakians withdrew from the region, but shortly launched a counterattack, retaking some of the lost territory. The entire skirmish lasted for a few days, and ended with a couple dozen dead on both sides. Still, we can consider this a success, and put a positive spin on it in propaganda pieces."
 hungary_flavor.106.a:0 "A great success for out nation."
 
 hungary_flavor.107.t:0 "Czechoslovakia allows referendum"
 hungary_flavor.107.d:0 "Czechoslovakia has agreed to the proposed referendum. The people of Southern Slovakia can finally decide, where they want to belong."
 hungary_flavor.107.a:0 "Let us hope for favorable results."
 
 hungary_flavor.108.t:0 "Czechoslovakia disallows referendum"
 hungary_flavor.108.d:0 "Czechoslovakia refused to host the referendum for Southern Slovakia. Relations between our countries have not deteriorated, but this is bound to drive a wedge between us in the future."
 hungary_flavor.108.a:0 "They can't deny our right to it forever."
 hungary_flavor.108.b:0 "Use our influence in the faction to force the referendum."
 
 hungary_flavor.109.t:0 "Yugoslavia enters the Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.109.d:0 "After the formation of the Visegrád Group, it was dubious at first, whether the alliance was strong enough to defend itself, let alone expand its influence. Yugoslavia has just announced its entry into the group, massively strengthening its influence in the region. This means that the Visegrád Group is no longer just a petty pact of nations, but a force to be reckoned with in the playing field of Europe."
 hungary_flavor.109.a:0 "A resounding success for the alliance."
 
 hungary_flavor.110.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines invitation"
 hungary_flavor.110.d:0 "The negotiations with Yugoslavia failed. We did not manage to convince them to join the Visegrád Group, and thus, our influence remains limited in the Balkans."
 hungary_flavor.110.a:0 "They don't know what they are missing."
 
 hungary_flavor.111.t:0 "Yugoslavia agrees to border changes"
 hungary_flavor.111.d:0 "During the settlement negotiations with Yugoslavia, it was agreed upon, that the Hungarian people needed to be kept on Hungarian soil. We managed to settle on which regions shall remain part of Yugoslavia, and which would become part of Hungary again. We have regained important land, with significant Hungarian population."
 hungary_flavor.111.a:0 "And yet, no blood needed to be shed."
 
 hungary_flavor.112.t:0 "Yugoslavia agrees to partial border change"
 hungary_flavor.112.d:0 "The negotiations were frought with arguments for both sides, and eventually, a compromise was reached. Some Hungarian population is to be transferred to Hungarian soil, and the territory of Prekmurje will be given to Hungary. This is not all that we hoped for, but at least the effort was not entirely in vain."
 hungary_flavor.112.a:0 "A fair agreement nonetheless."
 
 hungary_flavor.113.t:0 "Yugoslavia refuses to change borders"
 hungary_flavor.113.d:0 "The Yugoslavian government made it clear, that ceding territory was out of the question. They would not make any concessions, and they will defend the sovereignty of their nation by all means necessary. The negotiations achieved nothing."
 hungary_flavor.113.a:0 "A waste of effort."
 
 hungary_flavor.114.t:0 "Germany offers the rest of Vojvodina"
 hungary_flavor.114.d:0 "We already own Backa, which has the most Hungarians in Vojvodina, but Germany has offered the rest of it, as a sing of goodwill. Will we take their offer?"

 hungary_flavor.115.d:0 "Hitler has arranged to meet our regent, Miklós Horthy in Berlin, to discuss an important matter. He seeks to divide Czechoslovakia with Hungary, and wanted to know what role Hungary would play in this. If we were to play the role of aggressor, he might even give us the entirety of Slovakia, but we could settle for less if we wanted to."
 hungary_flavor.115.a:0 "We want no part of this."
 hungary_flavor.115.b:0 "We will be content with Carpathian Ruthenia."
 hungary_flavor.115.c:0 "We offer full cooperation, if they give us Slovakia."
 
 hungary_flavor.116.t:0 "Hitler agrees to our request"
 hungary_flavor.116.d:0 "The meeting was concluded, and Horthy has agreed with Hitler on the terms of our involvement in the partition of Czechoslovakia. We should now make preparations to fulfill our end of the bargain."
 hungary_flavor.116.a:0 "A successful meeting."
 
 hungary_flavor.117.t:0 "Inconclusive meeting"
 hungary_flavor.117.d:0 "After much discussion, there was no agreement in what Hungary will get after the partition. Hitler made no promises about our territorial gains."

 hungary_flavor.119.t:0 "Finland declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.119.d:0 "Suprisingly, Finland has rejected our proposal, eliminating the possibility, that our alliance comes to their aid. They are now surely doomed, for they alone can not stop the Soviet Union."

 hungary_flavor.120.t:0 "Peace with Britain"
 hungary_flavor.120.d:0 "We have now accomplished everything we set out to do, as our borders have been restored. The United Kingdom thought that they could contain our expansion by declaring war against us, and they have obviously failed. However, a drawn out war could hurt us just as much as it could hurt them, so it may benefit us to seek peace with them. They have bigger things to worry about, and we are content with what we have accomplished."
 hungary_flavor.120.a:0 "Send the peace offer."
 hungary_flavor.120.b:0 "We are not done with this war yet."
 
 hungary_flavor.121.t:0 "Britain accepts"
 hungary_flavor.121.d:0 "The United Kingdom has accepted the peace offer we sent. We returned all territory that was not claimed by us, and singed a peace treaty with them and their allies, officially nullifying the Treaty of Trianon."
 hungary_flavor.121.a:0 "Peace at last."
 
 hungary_flavor.122.t:0 "The war continues"
 hungary_flavor.122.d:0 "The United Kingdom refused our peace terms, so the war goes on as if nothing happened. Seems like we will need to use more conventional means to convince them to stop."
 hungary_flavor.122.a:0 "They will regret not signing the peace now."
 
 hungary_flavor.123.t:0 "Slovakian self-governance"
 hungary_flavor.123.d:0 "We have now acquired all Slovakian lands, and though they belonged to [Root.GetName] originally, there are those who propose the establishment of a Slovakian government, that would still answer to us, but would have some degree of independence. We could decide freely, which lands this new Slovakia would get, so we would be free to keep all lands, that are primarily inhabited by Hungarians."
 hungary_flavor.123.a:0 "We will not set up a new government."
 hungary_flavor.123.b:0 "Set up all of Slovakia as a puppet state."
 hungary_flavor.123.c:0 "Set up Northern Slovakia as a puppet state."

 hungary_flavor.124.d:0 "Now that we have signed the pact of friendship with Yugoslavia, it is time to consider our territorial claims towards them.

 hungary_flavor.124.a:0 "We will renounce all claims towards Yugoslavia."

 hungary_flavor.125.t:0 "Claims on Croatia"
 hungary_flavor.125.d:0 "Croatia is now its own state, having been separated from Yugoslavia. While we do still have territorial claims towards them, it might be the smart choice to abandon these claims, and instead seek friendship with Croatia."

 hungary_flavor.125.b:0 "We maintain all claims towards Croatia."
 
 hungary_flavor.126.t:0 "The Second Hungarian Republic"
 hungary_flavor.126.d:0 "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially announced the abolition the Hungarian monarchy.

 hungary_flavor.126.a:0 "Long live the republic!"
 
 hungary_flavor.127.t:0 "Fight for Transylvania"
 hungary_flavor.127.d:0 "Romania has taken sides in the current conflict, and is now at war with the Allies. If we want to, we could offer our help against Romania, in return for a promise, that we will get Transylvania at the end of the war. It is a risky proposal, as the British have not exactly been supportive of our territorial revision, but should they agree, we could end up restoring the entirety of Transylvania to our country."
 hungary_flavor.127.a:0 "Offer our help in return for Transylvania."
 hungary_flavor.127.b:0 "Try to stay neutral as long as possible."
 
 hungary_flavor.128.t:0 "United Kingdom refuses help"

 hungary_flavor.130.d:0 "Austria has refused the helping hand we reached towards them. They do not wish to be part of the Visegrád Group. They will no doubt be swallowed up in the international chaos soon, if they do not align themselves with one faction or the other."
 hungary_flavor.130.a:0 "A real shame."
 
 hungary_flavor.131.t:0 "Romania agrees to cede Southern Dobrudja"
 hungary_flavor.131.d:0 "Although we hoped to accomplish more, we only managed to secure the southern parts of dobrudja for Bulgaria in the negotiations with Romania. We will get the rest eventually, even if we have to pry it from Romania with war."
 hungary_flavor.131.a:0 "We have to be content with this for now."
 
 hungary_flavor.132.t:0 "Romania agrees to cede all of Dobrudja"
 hungary_flavor.132.d:0 "Romania has finally agreed to our demands. Bulgaria is now the owner of all of Dobrudja, greatly decreasing the amount of ethnic Bulgarians, who live in Romania."
 hungary_flavor.132.a:0 "And nobody needed to get hurt."
 
 hungary_flavor.133.t:0 "Romania refuses Bulgarian territorial demands"
 hungary_flavor.133.d:0 "Romania has had the wherewithal to outright refuse our demands for Dobrudja. They do not wish to give an inch of ground to Bulgaria. We will have to convince them otherwise with weapons, no doubt."
 hungary_flavor.133.a:0 "They will live to regret this decision."
 
 hungary_flavor.134.t:0 "Greece accepts alliance proposal"
 hungary_flavor.134.d:0 "Greece has accepted our generous offer of alliance. [ROOT.GetFactionName] is now one member stronger, and the southern reaches of the Balkans are under our influence."

 hungary_flavor.136.a:0 "Ok."
 
 hungary_flavor.137.t:0 "Germany seeks access through Hungarian lands to Poland"
 hungary_flavor.137.d:0 "Germany is at war with Poland, and they seek to open up a new front in the conflict, by attacking Poland through our lands. We could refuse, but perhaps it would be best to side with the victors here, and just let the German troops pass."

 hungary_flavor.137.b:0 "We won't betray our Polish friends."
 
 hungary_flavor.138.t:0 "Polish refugees"
 hungary_flavor.138.d:0 "Poland is losing ground against the Germans every day, and the war looks to be decided already. Some Polish troops can no longer retreat through other states to neutral territory, so they asked to pass our borders instead, to join their allies elsewhere. Allowing them through would certainly anger the Germans, but it would be an honorable act in helping our Polish friends."

 hungary_flavor.139.t:0 "The Zaolzie question"
 hungary_flavor.139.d:0 "Some of our advisors have suggested that we negotiate the transfer of Zaolzie to Poland. Seeing as they are our allies, and the territory in question is under our influence, it would certainly make sense to do so, as there is a significant Polish minority in the area."

 hungary_flavor.140.a:0 "Great news."
 
 hungary_flavor.141.t:0 "Germany refuses Burgenland deal"
 hungary_flavor.141.d:0 "The German government rejected our proposal. It would seem that they would rather see their army suffer, undermanned, than swallow their pride and return Burgenland to us."

 hungary_flavor.144.d:0 "We have recently acquired the region of Carpathian Ukraine. This land has historically been part of [ROOT.GetName], but its population is mostly Ruthenian.

 hungary_flavor.144.a:0 "We will not set up a new government."

 hungary_flavor.148.d:0 "We now have control over all of Transylvania. The region is historically a part of [ROOT.GetName], but it always enjoyed some form of autonomy. During the Turkish years, the region was its own country, sometimes aligning itself with Austria, and at other times serving the Ottomans.

 hungary_flavor.155.t:0 "Soviets refuse to support Polish communists"

There is little we can do to help them make these plans, but there are still ways we can contribute. They would have an easier time occupying territory, if the local population wouldn't resist them, so we could help them spread propaganda. We could also directly aid the preparations by sending secret agents to sabotage infrastructure buildings that the government relies on, and provide information to the rebels."
 hungary_flavor.158.a:0 "They will have to plan this on their own."

 hungary_flavor.177.t:0 "Poland refuses union"
 hungary_flavor.177.d:0 "Our union offer was refused by the Polish government. It is more than possible, that this decision has sealed the fate of Poland, yet we must continue to make every effort to keep poland in the war."

 hungary_flavor.179.t:0 "Germany refuses to invite Poland"
 hungary_flavor.179.d:0 "We have recently proposed to Germany, that they should invite Poland into the Axis, now that their government's line of thinking is more akin to ours. They replied, that they do not wish to seek an alliance with Poland at this point, as they might be the target of their ambitions in the near future. It would seem that we can't maintain frienship with both Germany, and Poland."
 hungary_flavor.179.a:0 "They should be focusing on our true enemies instead."
 
 hungary_flavor.180.t:0 "Poland refuses invitation"
 hungary_flavor.180.d:0 "Even though we managed to convince Germany of the benefits of inviting Poland into the Axis, the Polish government dismissed the invitation, stating that their interests do not align with that of our faction."

 hungary_flavor.182.d:0 "The new government of Slovakia has been set up, but we still need to decide for its leader. If we were to choose a Slovakian national to lead the government, it could boost the spirit of the spirit of the country, as its peope would view the government as their own. However, if we were to place a local Hungarian politician in charge, we would have a more firm grip on the government, and we could ensure that they contribute more to our coffers."

 hungary_flavor.193.t:0 "Hitler refuses increased military cooperation"
 hungary_flavor.193.d:0 "The meeting in Berlin was not successful. Szálasi left the negotiating table with a handful of nothing, and a sour taste in his mouth. Hitler refused to make any promises regarding the increased Hungarian role in military operations."

 hungary_flavor.198.d:0 "Communism has yet again set its ugly foot in Hungary. The only logical, and safe reaction to this is a renewed crusade against the red menace, this time sanctioned by the state, and strictly legal in nature. Many communists were rooted out during the so called 'White Terror' from 1919 to 1921, but it seems that their cancerous ideology can't be eradicated easily. We will scour the country for anyone who sympathisez with marxist ideas, and put them to justice."

The Straussler V3 prototype has been outfitted with pontoons, and successfully crossed the Danube river. This landmark achievement is the first of its kind, since no armoured tank has crossed major rivers in Europe before. We could very well exploit this breakthrough, to advance our military's amphibious armored capabilites."

 hungary_flavor.201.d:0 "László Rajk, a prominent minister in the communist government has fallen out of favor with Rákosi, and the party leadership. After László became involved in the financing of the ÁVO, he managed to turn multiple party members against himself, though he remains fairly popular with the masses. Tensions within the party have come to a boiling point, as the leader of the ÁVO, Gábor Péter has raised an official indictment against László, citing anti-party and anti-system behavior. His trial is going to be one of historical importance, so we should consider our stance carefully."

 hungary_flavor.266.d:0 "The British delegation conducting the negotiations awarded Hungary only a little more than the areas included in the original Rothemere plan! Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia have accepted the result, and we have also succeeded in improving our relations with these countries."
